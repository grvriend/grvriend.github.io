            With over 7 years experience as a software engineer, I have tackled and conquered problems of all shapes and sizes.  I am proficient in many software languages and specialize in writing REST API integrations.  I received my Computer Science bachelors degree from Dordt University in 2012 and am constantly learning the ever changing world of technology.  My favorite part of the job is research and troubleshooting complex problems.
